# In this exercise x and y are two random variables. The code at the top of the file randomly assigns them
# 1. If both are positive numbers, print "both positive"
# 2. If both are negative, print "both negative"
# 3. Otherwise, tell us which one is positive and which one is negative, e.g. "x is positive and y is negative"
