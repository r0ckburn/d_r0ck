# What does it mean that Python is a dynamically-typed language?
# 1 - Variables in Python can implicitly change to other types when comparing. For example, you can compare a string "2" and the number 2 using ==.
# 2 - Python variables can be assigned to different types and change types at will.
# 3 - Python is a more efficient language than C++
# 4 - All of the above.
