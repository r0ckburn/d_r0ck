# string literals can be declared with either single or double quotes

my_str = "a cat"

# or

my_other_string = 'another car'

# if you want to have qyotes inside of a string, you can't use the same type of quotes
# e.g. this_string = "this string "string" won't work"
# but you can use the opposite type inside of a string
# e.g.

third_string = 'this string has "quotes" inside of it'

fourth_string = "this string also has 'quotes' inside of it"
