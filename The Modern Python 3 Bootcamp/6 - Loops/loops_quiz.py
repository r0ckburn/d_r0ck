'''
for loops are used to loop over:
'''

# loopy objects
# numbers
# iterable objects
# lines of code

print("iterable objects")

'''
what is the tradeoff when using while loops for looping?
'''

# while loops are more flexible since you explicitly state the start and end conditions, but they require more setup than for loops.

# while loops are faster than for loops bt require more setup.

# while loops can loop infinitely and give you more control, but they cannot be used to iterate over iterable objects.

print("while loops are more flexible since you explicitly state the start and end conditions, but they require more setup than for loops")

'''
what does the break keyword do?
'''

# exits the loop at the beginning of the next iteration
# breaks your code
# exits the loop at the end of this iteration
# exits the loop immediately

print("exits the loop immediately")

'''
what does the following code print?
'''

for x in range(5):
    print(x)

# 1,2,3,4,5
# 1,2,3,4
# 0,1,2,3,4
# 0,1,2,3,4,5

print("0,1,2,3,4")
